I was previously a _PhD Student_ at **Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE)** and am now a _Postdoctoral Researcher_ at the **Université of Québec à Montréal (UQAM)**.

Most of my work has revolved around past tropical variability (ENSO, IOD, monsoons, etc.). I am now focusing on tropical-polar interactions.
